# Problem 1: Basic Arithmetic Calculator

## 🔍 Description
This Python program performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on two numbers provided by the user.

---

## 📌 Functionality
- Takes two integer inputs from the user.
- Performs and displays the result of:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Input Collection**:
   - Prompts the user to enter the first number.
   - Prompts the user to enter the second number.
   - Both inputs are converted from string to integer using `int()`.

2. **Arithmetic Operations**:
   - **Addition**: Adds the two numbers using `+`.
   - **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first using `-`.
   - **Multiplication**: Multiplies the two numbers using `*`.
   - **Division**: Divides the first number by the second using `/`.

3. **Output**:
   - Each result is printed with a clear message using `print()`.

# Problem 2: Full Name Greeting

## 🔍 Description
This Python program asks the user to input their first and last name, combines them, and prints a personalized greeting message.

---

## 📌 Functionality
- Takes two string inputs from the user (first name and last name).
- Concatenates the names without a space.
- Displays a greeting message using the combined name.

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Input Collection**:
   - Prompts the user to enter their first name.
   - Prompts the user to enter their last name.
   - Inputs are collected as strings using `input()`.

2. **String Concatenation**:
   - Combines `first_name` and `last_name` using `+`.
   - Note: No space is added between them, so the names will appear directly joined (e.g., JohnDoe).

3. **Output**:
   - Displays a welcome message using an `f-string`.
